## Overview

This Python script uses the Tkinter library to visualize three popular sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Bubble Sort. The graphical representation helps users understand the sorting process by animating the movement of bars.

## Features

- **Insertion Sort**: This algorithm builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

- **Selection Sort**: Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and putting it at the beginning.

- **Bubble Sort**: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Usage

1. Run the script: `python visualize_sorting.py`
2. Click on the "Shuffle" button to generate a new set of bars with random heights.
3. Choose one of the sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, or Bubble Sort.
4. Click on the selected algorithm button to start the sorting animation.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation

No additional installation steps are required. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Notes

- The bars represent elements to be sorted, and their heights represent the values being compared.
- The bars change color during the sorting process. The minimum height is colored in green, and the maximum height is colored in white.

Feel free to explore and learn from the visual representation of sorting algorithms!
