## Overview

This Python script uses the Tkinter library to visualize three popular sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Bubble Sort. The graphical representation helps users understand the sorting process by animating the movement of bars.

## Features

- **Insertion Sort**: This algorithm builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

- **Selection Sort**: Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and putting it at the beginning.

- **Bubble Sort**: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Usage

1. Run the script: `python visualize_sorting.py`
2. Click on the "Shuffle" button to generate a new set of bars with random heights.
3. Choose one of the sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, or Bubble Sort.
4. Click on the selected algorithm button to start the sorting animation.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation

No additional installation steps are required. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Notes

- The bars represent elements to be sorted, and their heights represent the values being compared.
- The bars change color during the sorting process. The minimum height is colored in green, and the maximum height is colored in white.
